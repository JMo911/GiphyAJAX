# Giphy Application

## Purpose
This application serves to help users quickly find their favorite sport gifs at the click of a button. 

## How it works
The application makes an AJAX call to the giphy api and displays top 10 results for whichever sport the user chooses. I've added an easy to use form so that the user can add buttons for new sports. The api call gives 200 results, but only displays 10 at a time so the user doesn't get overwhelmed and has easy access to as many choices as they would like.
